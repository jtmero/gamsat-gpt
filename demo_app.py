Sure, let's dive into a challenging scientific reasoning question.

**Stem**

In recent research on quantum entanglement, scientists have been investigating the phenomenon of non-locality and its implications on information transfer. One of the experiments involves entangled particles A and B, where particle A is kept on Earth and particle B is sent to a satellite orbiting the planet. The entanglement is such that measuring a property (e.g., spin) of particle A immediately determines the corresponding property of particle B, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon appears to contradict classical theories that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Critics argue that hidden variables could explain this phenomenon without violating relativity principles. In this experiment, the observation of spin states is conducted under varying experimental conditions, including different distances between the particles, different materials used in the measurement apparatus, and varying atmospheric conditions. The scientists record the frequency of correlations between the states of particles A and B, noting that the observed synchronization does not diminish with increased distance or environmental noise. They hypothesize that the entanglement is robust enough to resist any local interference, suggesting a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.

**Question**

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the implications of the experiment on quantum entanglement and information transfer?

A. The experiment demonstrates that information can travel faster than the speed of light.  
B. The results suggest that quantum entanglement is not affected by local environmental factors.  
C. The findings support the existence of hidden variables that explain the synchronization of entangled particles.  
D. The outcomes indicate that quantum entanglement may be fundamentally flawed due to unresolved noise interference issues.

**Can you find any evidence supporting or opposing option A?**

**Problem Stem:**
In quantum mechanics, the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles become so deeply linked that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This peculiar behavior has puzzled scientists and led to various interpretations, including the famous EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paradox, which questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics.

Consider an experimental setup where a pair of entangled photons is generated. The photons travel to two separate locations, A and B, where their polarizations are measured along specific axes. According to quantum mechanics, the measurement outcomes at A and B are perfectly correlated.

Recent studies have introduced an additional layer of complexity to this phenomenon by examining how environmental noise affects entanglement. In one such study, researchers subjected one of the entangled photons to different levels of depolarizing noise. Depolarizing noise randomizes the polarization state of a photon to some extent, described probabilistically by a parameter 𝑝, where 0≤𝑝≤1. When 𝑝=0, there is no noise and the polarization remains perfect; when 𝑝=1, the polarization is completely randomized.

Given these conditions, consider the effects of depolarizing noise on the entanglement of photon pairs and their subsequent measurement outcomes. Furthermore, analyze how these influences align with various quantum mechanical principles and interpretations, including the collapse of the wavefunction and non-locality.

Question: Given the experimental conditions described, which of the following statements is most likely correct regarding the correlation of measurement outcomes at locations A and B?

**Options:**
A. If the depolarizing noise parameter 𝑝 is high, the measurement outcomes at A and B will show no correlation.

B. Regardless of the depolarizing noise parameter 𝑝, the measurement outcomes at A and B will remain perfectly correlated due to the nature of entanglement.

C. The correlation between the measurement outcomes at A and B decreases as the depolarizing noise parameter 𝑝 increases, but does not completely disappear even at 𝑝=1.

D. If the depolarizing noise parameter 𝑝 is low, the measurement outcomes at A and B will be perfectly correlated, but as 𝑝 increases, these correlations diminish and eventually become random.

Can you find any evidence supporting or opposing option A?
